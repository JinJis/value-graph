# Backend Refactoring Plan (RF-01 … RF-18)

> **Goal:** reduce structural debt in the backend services **without changing behavior**.
> Pure structure/maintainability work — every task ships with the touched service's unit tests
> green + the relevant e2e/coverage harness still passing (Definition of Done, CLAUDE.md §5).
>
> **Process:** one task per PR/commit; **tag the `RF-id`** in the branch/commit/PR. Pull tasks in
> phase order (0 → 1 → 2 → 3). Update the **Status** column in the same change. This doc is the
> task source for the backend refactor — derived from a 6-service parallel audit (2026-06-25).

## Guardrails — refactors must PRESERVE these invariants (CLAUDE.md §2)

A refactor that touches any of these must keep the behavior identical:

- **Manifest/catalog is the single source of truth** — REST docs, MCP tools, RAG registration,
  entitlement, metering, agent tool list, builder categories all derive from it. Every Resource
  carries `category` + `cadence` (load fails if missing). Don't fork it.
- **Gateway is the only path to data** (auth → entitlement → rate-limit → meter/audit). Don't bypass
  or split the enforcement point. Entitlement = activation.
- **Keys server-side only.** **Gemini-only, one router** — no other provider, no forked tenancy.
- **No keyword/heuristic/if-ladder judgment** — routing, clarification, decomposition, difficulty,
  guardrail intent are LLM-judged. A refactor must not (re)introduce keyword logic.
- **No number without a source** (`source`+`as_of`+`freshness`+`cadence`); unbuilt → 501, never fabricate.
- **No forecasting/advice** (refused at the agent boundary, label shown). Alerts/briefs stay facts-only.
- **Search stays fail-safe** (a reranker/store failure falls back, never 500s the user).

## Status legend

`TODO` · `WIP` · `DONE` · `BLOCKED` · `DROPPED`. Severity = maintainability impact. Effort:
S(<1h) · M(half-day) · L(multi-day).

## Phase 0 — Quick wins (safe, small, do first)

| ID | Task | Service | Sev | Eff | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RF-01** | Dead-code + config-bug sweep. **DONE:** removed duplicate KIS keys in `config.py`; deleted ~90 LOC of legacy keyword-routing dead code from agent-engine `routing.py` (kept only the live `resolve_ticker`/`_user_text`). **Verified NOT dead (kept):** `opendart.as_reported()` (KR route `financials.py:108` calls it — honest empty per invariant #6), `store/ingest.py` `_STATEMENTS`/`_SKIP` (used by `ingest_ticker`/KR bulk), `jobs.py` type hints (already present), `evidence.py` (already documented). | datasets, agent-engine | high | S | DONE |
| **RF-02** | Shared provider number-parsing: new `providers/_parse_utils.py` (`parse_int`/`parse_float`, comma-aware) replacing `_num` (sec_edgar + fmp), `_i`/`_f` (kis) via import-alias (zero call-site churn). | datasets | high | S | DONE |
| **RF-03** | Single provenance field tuple: collapsed `_PROV` (`store.py`) + `_PROVENANCE` (`models.py`) into one shared `models.PROVENANCE_FIELDS`. | rag | med | S | DONE |

## Phase 1 — Cross-cutting foundations (highest value; other refactors build on these)

| ID | Task | Service | Sev | Eff | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RF-04** | Router toolkit `routers/_common.py` (`validate_interval`/`validate_period` + `INTERVALS`/`PERIODS`, `gather_best_effort`, `tickers_response`). Migrated 8 routers (prices, technical, financials, metrics, gurus, company, filings, earnings) — removed the duplicated `_INTERVALS`/`_PERIODS`/`_check_period`, the `_one`+gather+filter pattern (×3), and the `list_tickers→TickersResponse` one-liners (×5). Verified live: identical 400 messages + responses. | datasets | high | M | DONE |
| **RF-05** | `jobs.run_ticker_job(kind, market, spec, tickers, ingest_one)` — the per-ticker best-effort job lifecycle (start→progress→finish, -1 on failure, success/error finalize, to_thread-wrapped). Migrated `run_prices_ingest` + `run_corp_actions_ingest` onto it (byte-identical behavior). Split `prices_ingest.py` → `prices_ingest.py` (prices + `price_coverage`) + `corp_actions_ingest.py` + shared `_ingest_helpers.py`. **news/filing left as-is** — their job shapes differ (single-pass / total-sum, no failed-note), migrating would change the admin job record. Verified live. | datasets | high | M | DONE |
| **RF-06** | Upstream loader cache. **Audit premise was mostly wrong**: SEC `_ticker_index` + DART `_corp_map` *already* share `app.cache.TTLCache.get_or_set`; only KIS's token rolled its own (dict + lock + 23h TTL) because `TTLCache` loaded the factory **outside** the lock (a cold-cache thundering herd KIS couldn't afford at ~1/min issuance). **Did:** upgraded `TTLCache` to **single-flight per key** (factory runs once under concurrent cold access; different keys still parallel), then migrated the KIS token onto a dedicated `TTLCache(23h-60s)` — dropped the bespoke dict/lock/double-check. Upstream errors already go through `app.errors` (`upstream_error`) + the `fetch_*` helpers — left as-is. Verified live (SEC cached path) + a single-flight unit test. | datasets | high | M | DONE |
| **RF-07** | Catalog single-source: merged the two parallel `_CATEGORY` + `_CADENCE` maps (60 entries each) into one `_RESOURCE_META: (cid,name) → (Category, Cadence)` and the two near-identical `_apply_*` fns into one `_apply_resource_meta` (keeps the load-time missing/stale assertion). Adding a tool now touches 2 places, not 3, and category+cadence sit on one line (can't drift). Chose the meta-map merge over inlining on all 60 Resources to avoid risky transcription edits to invariant #8's single source. Merge generated programmatically; **proved byte-identical** (60 tools' category+cadence unchanged) in-process + live `/catalog`. | datasets | med | M | DONE |

## Phase 2 — God-file structural splits

| ID | Task | Service | Sev | Eff | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RF-08** | `artifacts.py`: replaced the 367-line, 19-branch `_build_artifacts` `if name.endswith(...)` ladder with a `tool-suffix → handler` registry (`_BUILDERS`) + a 20-line dispatcher + 20 named, self-guarded handlers (each returns `[]` when the shape doesn't fit). Adding a chartable tool is now one handler + one registry row. Behavior proven by the suite (all 23 tool suffixes tested → 99 pass). The `enrich_artifacts()` extraction moved to **RF-10** (it touches chat/agent call sites). | agent-engine | high | M | DONE |
| **RF-09** | Split `agent.py` 809→282: extracted `intake.py` (235: `TaskIntake`, `analyze_task` + guardrail, intake prompt/schema) and `enrichment.py` (351: `suggest_followups`/`refine_evidence` + their prompts/schemas) out of the orchestration loop. Used the file's existing **back-compat re-export** pattern (agent.py re-exports the moved names) → **zero importer churn** across chat/main/orchestrator/tests. Prompts/schemas **co-located with their cluster** (cohesion) rather than a central `prompts.py`. `results.py` chat↔agent dedup → **RF-10** (chat.py work). agent-engine 99 pass, 0 breakage. | agent-engine | high | L | DONE |
| **RF-10** | Extracted `artifacts.enrich_artifacts(artifacts, history, task, model, backend, *, annotate_timeout=None)` — the PH-VIZ post-loop sequence (markers + price lines → technical overlays → bounded Gemini annotation) that `run_agent` and the chat stream both ran inline (the dedup deferred from RF-08/09). Streaming passes `annotate_timeout` so annotation never delays `done`; `run_agent` awaits directly — same behavior, one definition (also the bounded-Gemini wrapper for the annotate path). **Consciously skipped** the SSE event-builder + streaming citation/artifact-assembly dedup: cosmetic / high-risk against the live SSE contract, and the two assembly blocks genuinely diverge (Citation objects vs `_citations()`+args). agent-engine 99 pass. | agent-engine | med | M | DONE |
| **RF-11** | Ownership DRY: new `orm_helpers.py` with `check_owned(entity, …)` + `get_owned(db, model, id, email, detail, *, allow_global=False)` — the load-by-PK + 404-unless-owned guard that every CRUD route repeated. Migrated 10 sites (agents update/delete, alerts `_owned`, board rename/delete/update_pin/annotate/refresh/unpin, main run_stream). **Scoped out** (risk/value): the full list/get/create/update/delete **route factory** (restructures FastAPI routes — risky, routes have varied logic), `JsonColumn`/`to_dict`/`safe_json_list` (the `_out`s carry module-specific computed fields; `json.loads(x or "[]")` is a clear 1-liner — marginal). studio-api 51 pass. | studio-api | high | M | DONE |
| **RF-12** | Split `alerts.py` (565) into render/model (pure `render_message`/`fire_alert`/`compute_next_fire`) + scheduler glue + routes; move trigger metadata + fallback templates into one `TRIGGERS` table. | studio-api | high | L | TODO |
| **RF-13** | Extract `idempotent_clone()` (community + source_id + idempotent) from `prompts.import_prompt` into a reusable module, ready for agents/analysts cloning. | studio-api | med | M | TODO |
| **RF-14** | Split `admin/main.py` (986) into per-section `APIRouter` modules + a `state.py` (DB_STATUS/ENGINES/TABLES) + a `ServiceClient` wrapping the repeated `_safe_get`/`httpx.AsyncClient` fetches. | admin | high | M | TODO |
| **RF-15** | Admin HTML component lib in `views.py` (card/tile/table/status-row builders) + shared status/badge constant maps (4 inline dicts → 1). Jinja2 adoption is a **separate** decision, not in scope here. | admin | med | M | TODO |

## Phase 3 — Gateway / RAG hardening + test gaps

| ID | Task | Service | Sev | Eff | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RF-16** | Gateway pipeline: extract an `EntitlementResolver` + make the auth→entitle→ratelimit→meter→audit chain explicit/composable; `AuditAction` enum; TTL-based rate-limit bucket cleanup; validate `Activation.byo_credentials` JSON at upsert. | control-plane | med | M | TODO |
| **RF-17** | RAG backend registry: unify `get_embedder`/`get_reranker`/`get_store` with startup config validation + a lifespan shutdown hook; a shared filter-matcher so MemoryStore/PgVectorStore have identical filter/tenant semantics; structured reranker-failure logging. | rag | med | M | TODO |
| **RF-18** | Test gaps: ingest job lifecycle (`start_job`/progress/`finish_job`); RAG tenant isolation + reranker-fallback + Memory↔Pg store parity; gateway rate-limit key isolation + minute-boundary; MCP "tool list derives from catalog" assertion. | all | med | L | TODO |

## Deferred / rejected (value vs. risk)

- **asyncpg migration** (async DB everywhere) — behavior-risky, large scope; not a pure refactor.
- **hypothesis property/fuzz tests** — net-new test infra, not refactoring.
- **Jinja2 for the admin panel** — medium value, real effort; revisit after RF-14/15 land.
